Job hunting and pandemic...Two things that can make one jitter!

At a time where our tomorrow is controlled by ever-changing lockdowns and uncertainty, you're probably wondering why I'm even searching for a new role when my previous was absolutely perfect. Well my friends...Carpe diem! And when life hands you lemons, you make lemonade right? :)

Truth is, I'm moving countries...Yay! Totally not a spoiler, but I'll cover moving countries during a pandemic in another blog.

So...We all know that with any new job, one must interview. Doesn't that word make you nervous already? You'd think as a dancer whose performed in front of many, I wouldn't get nervous. Well...turns out I'm still human and interviews make my heart race like Usain Bolt when he set a world record at the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin. 

Anyhow, Interviews are a great way of getting to know future colleagues as well as your future employer but, the key takeaway for me was that I really got to understand my strengths and my weaknesses. After submitting a couple of take-home tech tests, almost 2-hour long technical interviews with live coding challenges and getting rejected...I slowly began to feel defeated! But with the support from my loving partner, family and friends as well as remembering that everything happens for a reason and that if its meant to be, it will be. I was able to push through that feeling and eventually secured my next role...Happy days! 

So what did I learn from this?

## 1. Take the time to reflect on your past experiences.
Taking the time during or in between jobs to reflect will help you identify your achievements, contributions as well as challenges you experienced. They'll help you to understand the things you liked in that role or company and the things you didn't quite like so that you can use these as things to look out for in your future role. But essentially, its a way for you to measure your success as well as areas for self-development or maybe just to think about how you could of handled a situation better. 

Joting these down somewhere in a notebook can also be helpful when needing to answer those difficult behavioural questions in an interview.

## 2. Learn the fundamentals first.
A great developer will ensure that they have a solid foundation. Just like a house, if you try to build on top of a weak foundation, the house will look beautiful and exactly how you want it to, but it will eventually fall. The same goes with being a Frontend Developer, or a Developer in general.

Though learning the newest trends is important to remain employable, it's even more important to make sure we learn, understand and are able to apply those fundamentals. Being able to do this with your eyes closed can be a really powerful skill and this is what I believe will make you stand out from the rest especially in this competitive industry.

It's like in Tag Rugby, you can be an amazing player and be able to throw the ball as far as possible into the hands of your team mate or even score the best try but being able to read the game, adapt and play moves accordingly is what can make you a really dangerous player. Then everyone will want to have you on their team!

## 3. Believe in yourself.
It's easy to feel like you're not good enough especially when you get loads of rejections, not being able to give the correct answer or an answer at all during a technical interview or even taking too long to solve a problem during a live coding challenge. All of these, at least in my case, can make one feel like they are not good enough. But rest a sure, you are amazing!

Remember that every developer has been in the same position at some point in their career. The key thing to remember is that its a journey of learning and growth. For every step that brings you forward, there is always going to be something that takes you two steps back but its up to you to use those setbacks as motivation to make your journey successful. 

And like I earlier mentioned, interviews can be super nerve-racking but the important thing to remember is that it's a two way street. You (the prospective candidate) and the company (your prospective employer) so really try to get as much information about the role and company as you can. And from one human to another, stay calm, think about what you are going to say before you say it and most importantly, just be yourself!
