Last April I joined my very first virtual hackathon hosted by Women Driven Development (WDD).

As a first timer, I didn't really know what to expect. I just knew that getting involved would be a great experience.

The hackathon invited UK frontliners of the Coronavirus pandemic to share the challenges they face and brought tech professionals together to develop digital solutions that would help and support them and our communities at large.

## Pre-Hack Night

The floor was opened to the speakers to share their stories of how the spread of COVID-19 has largely impacted their line of work. From our National Health Service, more commonly known as the NHS to education and occupational therapy, the pandemic has effected many and has effected the way many professions operate increasing the need for digital solutions more than ever.

Hearing the different stories shared at the pre-hack night was a real eye opener. One in particular was shared by Occupational Therapist, Asma Bhol who spoke about her work within the Violence Against Women & Girls Sector and the challenges faced around Privacy and Confidentiality especially during a time where we are being told to stay at home. It really made me think about just how powerful technology is and how much influence it can have on our day-to-day.

I came out of that pre-hack night with empathy, gratitude and a whole lot of motivation ready to start innovating.

## Kick Off

The hackathon began with a 9AM kick off with each team giving an elevator-pitch of their projects. And ended with a live YouTube stream with Eddie Jaoude of behind the scenes at the hackathon with each team giving insights to the day so far.

(48 hours later, a couple of slack calls and many more git commits...)

(drumroll...)

Our team gave birth to [tellmyGP](https://medium.com/ukvscovidhack/tell-my-gp-63de96231e38):

# "A web app that allows patients of a GP surgery to track their COVID-19 symptoms daily and send to their GP. This will help triage patients who require person to person assessment. tellmyGP will also help GPs to track the health of their community and feel part of it at the time of isolation."

## Demo Day

Demo Day - a day of relief or a day of technical doom!

We all know demo's can go square when a live demo is involved but lucky for us, all was swell!

Each team had a 10-minute window to showcase their work and it was amazing to see in just two days, loads of incredible ideas coming to life. What was even more incredible was seeing different practices working collaboratively, bringing their expertise to create and build.

## Conclusion

It was a truly inspirational experience where I was able to connect, collaborate and create with new people. Though it was nervewracking speaking infront of a bunch of people, it was also enjoyable. Hackathons are great for creating an environment that truly encourages innovation, brings people together and challenge oneself to think outside the box. I'd definitely join another one!
